##Anakata

Introducing Anakata, a napster like clone for transferring files over
a network using a peer-to-peer model.

Anakata uses a client server model to keep track of files on the network.

1. TrackR - TrackR is the server utility which keeps track of the user shared
   files on the network.

2. Anakata Client - This client comes with the capability to interact with
   Trackr and get file locations on the network and each client can double up
   as a server serving its file contents to other clients.

TrackR only keeps track of the files.
